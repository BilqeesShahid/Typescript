//Greetings: Start with the array you used in Exercise 10, but instead of just printing each person’s name, print a message to them. The text of each message should be the same, but each message should be personalized with the person’s name.

//Your Own Array: Think of your favorite mode of transportation, such as a motorcycle or a car, and make a list that stores several examples. Use your list to print a series of statements about these items, such as “I would like to own a Honda motorcycle.”

//Assignment 13
//Guest List: If you could invite anyone, living or deceased, to dinner, who would you invite? Make a list that includes at least three people you’d like to invite to dinner. Then use your list to print a message to each person, inviting them to dinner.
/*let Guest:string[]=["Sara","Fatima","Yusra"]

//Changing Guest List: You just heard that one of your guests can’t make the dinner, so you need to send out a new set of invitations. You’ll have to think of someone else to invite.

//More Guests: You just found a bigger dinner table, so now more space is available. Think of three more guests to invite to dinner.
//• Start with your program from Exercise 15. Add a print statement to the end of your program informing people that you found a bigger dinner table.
//• Add one new guest to the beginning of your array.
//• Add one new guest to the middle of your array. • Use append() to add one new guest to the end of your list. • Print a new set of invitation messages, one for each person in your list.let Guest:string[]=["Aisha","Fatima","Sara","Faizan"]
